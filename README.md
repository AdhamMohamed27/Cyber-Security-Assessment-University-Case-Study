# 🛡️ Cyber Security Assessment – University Case Study

A group project for **CSCE 3423 – Introduction to Cyber Security**, focused on applying the 8 core domains of cybersecurity to a real-world university case study. The objective was to assess security risks, propose mitigations, and align recommendations with the ISO/IEC 27000 series standards.
