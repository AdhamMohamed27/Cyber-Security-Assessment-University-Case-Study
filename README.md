# 🛡️ Cyber Security Assessment – University Case Study

A group project for **CSCE 3423 – Introduction to Cyber Security**, focused on applying the 8 core domains of cybersecurity to a real-world university case study. The objective was to assess security risks, propose mitigations, and align recommendations with the ISO/IEC 27000 series standards.

## 📘 Project Overview

A fictional UK university transitioned to a more online/blended learning model post-COVID, creating new cybersecurity challenges. This report evaluates how the university can improve its security posture across 8 key domains and identifies gaps that need addressing to reduce risk and improve resilience.
